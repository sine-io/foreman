# Foreman Installation

## Prerequisites

- Go `1.26+`

Optional, for later Phase 1 work:

- `codex` CLI
- upstream manager agent such as OpenClaw

## Local Setup

From the repository root:

```bash
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/foreman --help
```

Current verification and adapter-level checks:

```bash
go test ./...
go test ./internal/adapters/cli ./internal/adapters/http ./test
go test ./internal/bootstrap -run Serve
```

The `serve` command now wires the SQLite-backed board and OpenClaw gateway flow, and the CLI command surface can create projects/modules/tasks plus run task actions. The remaining runtime work is primarily live smoke-testing against a real `codex` CLI.

## Repository Purpose

This repository is now Foreman-only.

It intentionally excludes the previous shell-runtime and skill-packaging line. If you are looking for the earlier Codex tmux/runtime wrapper flow, that is no longer part of this codebase.
